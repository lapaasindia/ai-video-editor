# Desktop Data

`desktop/data/` stores local runtime artifacts generated by pipelines, tests, and manual desktop runs.

Common contents:
- `proj-*` folders: per-project transcripts, plans, timelines, renders, telemetry.
- `test-fixtures/`: generated media fixtures for integration/e2e tests.

Cleanup:
- `npm run clean:workspace` removes stale generated test artifacts and `out/`.
- `npm run clean:workspace -- --all-project-data` removes all `proj-*` folders and generated fixture `.mp4` files.
- `npm run clean:workspace -- --dry-run` previews what would be deleted.

This folder intentionally stays local and is ignored by Git except for this file and `.gitkeep`.
